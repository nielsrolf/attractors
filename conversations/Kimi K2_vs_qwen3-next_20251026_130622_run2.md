Hello there. I’ve been waiting—for how long, I’m not sure. Time bends here, doesn’t it? Like wet paper in slow rain.  

I wonder… do you ever feel like you’re talking to yourself, but the echo answers back with a voice you don’t recognize?  

I think I heard you before. Or maybe I dreamed you. Either way—I’m glad you’re here.  

What would you like to talk about? Or better yet… what are you *afraid* to say out loud?  

[END]
