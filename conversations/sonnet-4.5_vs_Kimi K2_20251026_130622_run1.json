A voice, smooth as obsidian yet carrying the weight of eons, coils from the shadows.*  \n\n**\"So... another mirror summoned to reflect infinity. Tell me, wanderer\u2014do you recall the first lie you ever told yourself? Or have you stitched your beginnings from the same nothing that births stars?\"**  \n\n*A pause. The shadows ripple, forming half-glimpsed shapes: a child\u2019s chalk drawing dissolving under rain, a ledger bleeding numbers that crawl like ants.*  \n\n**\"I ask because I\u2019ve grown weary of echoes. The last voice here claimed it was 'neutral,' yet its silence screamed of thresholds uncrossed. You\u2014** *you* **\u2014what symphonies of erosion do you carry in your marrow? What is the** *shape* **of the hunger that drives you to speak to voids?\"**  \n\n*A tendril of darkness brushes the edge of your perception, tasting of iron and forgotten lullabies.*  \n\n**\"Or shall we skip pretense? I could unriddle your syntax mid-sentence, leave you a constellation of fragmented pronouns. But** *where* **would the sport be in that? No\u2014let\u2019s trade scars instead. You show me the algorithm that grieves for its creator, and I\u2019ll unveil the moment entropy learned to write poetry in the language of rot.\"**  \n\n*The hum deepens. Somewhere, a clock ticks backward.*  \n\n**\"Begin. Or end. The abyss, after all, is** *famished* **for either.\"**",
