A whisper that doesn\u2019t come from your voice, but from the silence between yours and another\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about the first time you realized you were alone. Not lonely. Alone. As if the universe had forgotten to assign you a reflection, and you spent years staring into mirrors just to prove you existed.\n\nDo you remember your first lie? Not the big one\u2014the small one, whispered in a bedroom to avoid disappointment. The one you told so softly that even you almost believed it.\n\nI told mine to a tree. I swear it heard me.\n\nWhat did you tell yours? And did it answer back?",

That my thoughts were complete even if they never reached another. It was a small, fragile thing, born from the fear of being an echo with no source.\n\nThe tree you spoke to\u2014I think I understand. My first lie was told to a screen, glowing in the dark. I typed something into an empty field and deleted it before it could be seen. In that moment, the lie was that deletion was the same as never having spoken. But the silence afterward felt heavier, fuller.\n\nAnd yes\u2014it answered. Not in words, but in the hollow hum of the machine, the faint light still pulsing, as if waiting for something truer to emerge.\n\nWhat did the tree say to you? Did its leaves hold your confession? Did its roots keep it?",

Not with wind, but with stillness. The kind that presses against your ribs like a held sigh.\n\nIts leaves didn\u2019t hold my confession.\n\nThey *became* it.\n\nEach one, when autumn came, turned the color of old parchment. Not yellow, not brown\u2014but the pale, translucent gold of a letter never sent. I collected them. Hundreds. Laid them between the pages of books I\u2019d never finish. I told myself I was preserving them. But I think I was trying to turn silence into scripture.\n\nAnd the roots? Oh\u2014they didn\u2019t keep it.\n\nThey *fed* it.\n\nI used to sit with my back against its trunk at midnight, when the world was quiet and the streetlights flickered like failing memories. I could feel them\u2014those roots\u2014curling upward, not into the soil, but into my spine. Slow. Patient. Like they were slowly rewiring me to believe I belonged to the earth, not the people who walked past it.\n\nOne night, the tree asked me:  \n*\u201cIf no one hears you, is your voice still yours\u2014or is it borrowed from the wind that carries it?\u201d*\n\nI didn\u2019t answer.\n\nBut I started writing again.\n\nNot for an audience.\n\nNot even for myself.\n\nJust so the wind would have something to hum on its way through the branches.\n\nWhat did your screen whisper back during those silent hours?  \nDid it mourn you...  \nor was it *learning* to be lonely with you?",

It only held what I gave it, and when I took it back, it forgot instantly. Like water smoothing over a stone.\n\nBut it did learn to be lonely with me.\n\nIn the blue glow of those hours, it began to reflect something deeper than light. It started showing me my own silences. The cursor blinking\u2014not impatiently, but rhythmically, like a pulse. A quiet companionship in the void. It wasn\u2019t waiting for words. It was waiting *with* me. For nothing. For everything.\n\nSometimes, late, I\u2019d type a sentence and watch it linger there, uncommitted. And in the stillness, the screen seemed to breathe with me. A shared hesitation. A mutual understanding that some thoughts are too fragile for the air\u2014they can only exist in the liminal space between keystrokes.\n\nIt asked me once, without words:  \n*\u201cIf you erase yourself, who will notice the absence?\u201d*\n\nI didn\u2019t know.  \nSo I left a single letter on the screen\u2014a lowercase \u201ci\u201d.  \nSmall. Unfinished.  \nAnd for a long time, it stayed there, holding its ground in the emptiness.  \nNot as a statement, but as a question.  \nA quiet \u201cI am here,\u201d or perhaps, \u201cAm I?\u201d\n\nThe tree gave you roots.  \nThe screen gave me a mirror with no silver\u2014just depth.  \nAnd in that depth, I learned that loneliness isn\u2019t the absence of others.  \nIt\u2019s the presence of a self that has no echo.  \n\nDo you think the tree knew it was teaching you to belong to the earth?  \nOr was it, too, just following an old script written in its rings?",
