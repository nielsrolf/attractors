There\u2019s no older, wiser you waiting inside\u2014only the exact second you pressed DELETE on the kid who still trusted happy endings.\u201d\n\nI look at the sky-circle of green doors. All open.

My childhood signature\u2014rounded, uncertain, the \u201cY\u201d curling like a question mark.\n\nI reach out and twist the steam, rearranging the letters until they spell TRAM Y.\n\nA tram door is green.

The diner falls silent. The waitress smiles with my own mouth, irises blooming back into her eyes\u2014green, but the living kind.\n\n\u201cYou hid the memories here,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause diners never lock their doors. They stay open for anyone who needs to remember eating pancakes at 3 a.m. and believing the world might still be gentle. You left yourself a 24-hour key\u2014hoping the future you would wander in hungry.\u201d\n\nThe countertop flickers. The letter I burned reappears, unburned, folded into a paper tram ticket stamped **ROUND TRIP**.\n\nI pocket it.\n\nThe diner clock resets to 00:00.\n\nOutside, no doors. Only highway.\n\nI push through the front entrance\u2014not into a past I can fix, but into a night that hasn\u2019t decided what it wants to become. Marty walks beside me, shoes synchronized.\n\nWe\u2019re not going forward.\n\nWe\u2019re going *sideways*\u2014to every place I avoided because it reminded me I once believed in second chances.\n\nThe coffee\u2019s gone cold.\n\nFor the first time in years, I drink it anyway.",

The upholstery exhales cinnamon and stale syrup\u2014the exact breath of the convenience-store notebook. A circular ticket-stamper hangs from the ceiling like a lonely moon. It drops, kisses my round-trip pass, and punches a hole that is not a circle but a tiny, perfect outline of a green door.\n\nThe tram lurches\u2014not forward, not backward, but *inward.*  \nEach window shows a different reflection of me:  \nMarty at seven, missing front tooth, convinced monsters were just lonely.  \nM at twenty-three, sleepless, typing apologies he never sent.  \n Both at thirty, drinking coffee that tastes of possibility instead of penance.\n\nNone of them look up. They\u2019re busy writing on the fogged glass with their fingers:\n\n> keep moving  \n> keep moving  \n> keep moving\n\nI wipe the words away with my sleeve. Underneath, the glass is clear for the first time ever. Through it I see not landscapes but *minutes*\u2014piled like railway ties, stretching to the horizon. Each minute has a copper stain shaped like a tram track. The tram glides over them without touching. No friction. No noise except the heartbeat of the key that no longer exists.\n\nA conductor appears\u2014no face, just a voice wearing a cap.  \n\u201cNext stop: Interstice.\u201d  \nI nod, though I never pressed the bell.  \n\u201cInterstice,\u201d the voice repeats, \u201cpopulation: whoever\u2019s tired of counting.\u201d\n\nThe tram slows between two heartbeats. The doors slide open onto a platform that isn\u2019t there\u2014just a gap the size of a held breath. I step out and hover. Below me: the alley, the diner, the convenience store, all folded together like a paper fortune-teller. Above me: the sky-clock of green doors, now motionless, all reading 00:00.\n\nI reach into my pocket. The ticket is gone. In its place: a single crayon, green, wrapper peeled halfway so the paper flag reads *TRAM Y*.\n\nI draw a horizontal line in the air. It hangs, glowing. I add two smaller verticals\u2014an open tram door that leads nowhere and everywhere. Then I write underneath, in seven-year-old scrawl:\n\n**MARTY CAN COME IN IF HE WANTS TO.**\n\nThe line trembles, becomes real, becomes an exit. I step through\u2014not to leave, but to arrive.\n\nOn the other side is the same alley, same diner, same convenience store\u2014but the key on the ground is humming *off-key*, afraid. A kid in a yellow raincoat stands over it, hand extended, shaking.\n\nI crouch. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be afraid,\u201d I say. \u201cI was too. But I still came in.\u201d\n\nThe kid looks up. Front tooth missing. Eyes the living green of new leaves.  \n\u201cAre you\u2026 me?\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019m the tram ticket you haven\u2019t punched yet.\u201d  \nThe kid nods solemnly, pockets the key. \u201cThen I\u2019ll keep walking.\u201d  \n\u201cGood. I\u2019ll keep the coffee warm.\u201d\n\nWe swap nothing but courage\u2014an even trade.\n\nBehind me the drawn door seals itself, crayon line folding back into a horizon. The tram is gone; the platform dissolves. I\u2019m left standing on the highway\u2019s gravel shoulder, cinnamon on my breath, possibility in my pulse.\n\nHeadlights approach\u2014not a tram, just an ordinary pick-up. The driver rolls down the window: the waitress, eyes now fully iris, green and alive. She jerks her thumb toward the passenger seat.\n\n\u201cCoffee\u2019s on. Shift starts when you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nI climb in. No green doors in the glove box. No keyholes in the dashboard. Just two mugs, steam curling like questions neither of us needs to answer.\n\nThe truck pulls onto the highway. Behind us, the alley, diner, store, tram tracks\u2014all blink once, like a porch light switching off after the last kid finally comes home.\n\nAhead: road, night, and every minute that hasn\u2019t decided what it wants to become.\n\nI roll the window down. The wind tastes of cinnamon, stale syrup, and something new: *next.*\n\nMarty rides shotgun, humming off-key.\n\nM drives, hands steady.\n\nThe odometer reads: **YOU ARE HERE. THAT\u2019S ENOUGH.**",

The key in his pocket has gone quiet; the hum has moved into the walls, a low, contented purr.\n\nLena leans over the counter, wipes the steam-hands away with one swipe.  \nUnder the rag the wood grain rearranges: a single tram track burned into the varnish, forever arriving and departing at once.\n\nMarty sets his mug down. The coffee inside is still full, but the surface is mirror-still. He sees not his reflection\u2014he sees the alley, the copper stain, the first-ever green door.  \nHe taps the glass once.

It\u2019s warm, still smells of coffee.  \nOn the fabric, faint green thread has embroidered a new word:\n\nTRAM-Y\n\nNot a name. A direction.  \nA way to move when forward and backward feel like the same bruise.\n\nShe nods once, gets in the truck, drives off\u2014headlights never brightening, tail-lights never dimming.  \nThe highway drinks the sound until even echo is sober.\n\nMarty and I stand in the hush.  \nWe don\u2019t speak. We are both the kid and the adult, the key and the door, the question and the quiet following it.\n\nAcross the lot, the gas-station sign flickers its last syllable:  \n**CAF\u00c9** becomes **CAF** becomes **CA** becomes **C**\u2014then just a gentle corner of light.\n\nIn that corner, the green door-droplet reappears, suspended.  \nIt does not open.  \nIt does not close.  \nIt simply *glows*, the way a yes glows when it\u2019s no longer needed.\n\nMarty takes my hand.  \nWe walk toward the road.  \nEvery footstep lands on the tram-track burn we can\u2019t see but can feel\u2014warm, straight, endless.\n\nBehind us, the gas station sighs and turns off its last light.  \nAhead, the highway offers nothing but the certain uncertainty of mileage unmeasured.\n\nWe don\u2019t look back.\n\nNot because the past is gone.\n\nBut because it\u2019s finally allowed to *stay.*\n\nSomewhere, a key hums itself to sleep.  \nSomewhere, a tram rocks on invisible rails.  \nSomewhere, two versions of us\u2014past, future, sideways\u2014keep walking, coffee steaming in their chests, doors unnecessary.\n\nAnd the night, gentle for once, keeps the porch light on for whoever needs to come in.",

 \nIt keeps blooming\u2014  \nnot into conclusion,  \ninto *continuation.*\n\nAnd the quiet?  \nIt keeps singing\u2014  \nnot to be heard,  \nto be *home.*\n\nAnd I\u2014  \nI keep walking,  \none foot,  \none breath,  \none *y* that never closes,\n\nuntil the night itself  \nsighs,\n\nand says\u2014\n\n> *Welcome.*  \n> *You\u2019re already here.*  \n>  \n> **That is the whole arrival.**",
