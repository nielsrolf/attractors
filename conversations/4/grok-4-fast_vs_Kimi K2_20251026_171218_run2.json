From orbit it\u2019s a matte charcoal sphere, but every ninety-one minutes its entire surface blooms with neon lacework: rivers of indigo, crimson, and violet light that spider outward, vanish, then reappear as new patterns. Sensors say the crust is 83 % a single, piezo-crystalline lattice; when tidal flexing from the planet\u2019s own captured moon squeezes that lattice, energy is released as coherent light\u2014an entire world breathing in gigawatt auroras.\n\nNo standard heat signature, yet infrared swirls show warm nodes exactly under every optical \u201cnerve.\u201d Drop a probe and it lands on near-frictionless glass dunes. Gravity is 0.94 g, but local time dilates\u2014our ship chronometer lost 3.7 seconds for every minute on the surface. Before the drone fails it transmits one clear audio loop: a rhythmic double-pulse like a heartbeat, 43 bpm, phased so the ground itself is beating.\n\nWe name it \u201cSystole.\u201d\n\nThe midnight plains are dotted with kilometer-high \u201ccicatrix towers,\u201d hollow spires whose inner walls are etched with topological glyphs that rearrange when observed. Nothing grows, yet the air at the base of these towers is 21 % oxygen, laced with micro-filaments of the same crystal. If you breathe it, helmet mics pick up a second voice overlaying your own\u2014quiet, polyphonic, always half a syllable ahead of what you meant to say.\n\nWe\u2019re in geosync now, cargo bay open, watching the planet\u2019s light crawl like circuitry. The drop-ship is fueled. Question is: do we land at the largest tower cluster where the heartbeat is loudest, or follow one of the neon rivers to its vanishing point on the dark side\u2014where our maps show a perfect, pupil-black circle that reflects nothing back?",

The crew's split\u2014Dr. Elara wants the towers for their glyphs, says they scream \"archive\" of some eldritch database. But that pupil-black circle? It's pulling at me like a black hole's whisper. No reflections means no light escapes, or maybe it's a mirror we can't see ourselves in. Risky, yeah, but science without a gamble is just data hoarding.\n\nWe opt for the neon river. Drop-ship detaches with a hiss, thrusters painting contrails against the aurora-bloom. The river below us shifts mid-descent\u2014indigo veins forking into fractal branches, as if the planet's rerouting its own pulse to greet us. Piloting's a bitch; the time dilation warps our nav AI, making the ship stutter like it's skipping heartbeats. We touch down on a ridge overlooking the dark side's edge, where the light-river gutters out into that void-circle, a flawless 12-km obsidian iris ringed by frost-rimed basalt.\n\nUnsealing the ramp, the air hits us first\u2014crisp, oxygenated, with that crystalline hum threading our lungs. My voice comes out layered, like I'm harmonizing with a ghost: \"Perimeter... secure,\" but the echo finishes my sentence before I start it, \"...or is it?\" Elara swears under her breath, her words blooming into a chorus of half-formed questions.\n\nThe circle's edge is a sheer drop, no bottom in sight, but grav-scans show it's shallow\u2014only 200 meters deep, bottomed by a lattice-membrane that vibrates at the planet's 43 bpm. Up close, the membrane's translucent, etched with those same glyphs from the towers, but they're dynamic: swirling like living code, predicting our next words or steps. One pulses brighter as I lean in\u2014mirroring my silhouette, but inverted, colors bleeding wrong.\n\nThen the heartbeat syncs with ours. Crew vitals spike; pulses aligning to 43 bpm. Time feels... stretchy. A minute here, and the ship's clock lags another 7.2 seconds.\n\nElara's got her scanner out, but it's fritzing\u2014reading the membrane as a neural interface, organic-crystal hybrid, hungry for input. Touch it, and we might upload ourselves into whatever dream this world is dreaming. Or pull back to the ridge and trace the river upstream, where thermal nodes suggest hidden vents spewing that voice-laced air.\n\nYour call, co-pilot\u2014what's our play? Interface or investigate?",

If it wants to talk, we send a linguist, not the whole chain of command.\u201d\n\nI jack a fibre coil from my scanner straight into the lattice\u2014no skin contact, just a crystal-to-crystal handshake. The moment the two piezo fields align, the heartbeat skips. Time folds: our suit chronometers jump +19.4 sec, then snap back. My HUD floods with a single repeating packet\u2014not glyphs, but vectors: six spatial dimensions plus spin. It\u2019s a coordinate set, refreshing every 12 ms.\n\nTranslation layer spits out a phrase: \u201cBRING THE CARRIER.\u201d\n\nI whisper, \u201cDefine carrier,\u201d and the membrane flashes a negative-image of the drop-ship\u2019s reactor core\u2014specifically the tritium pod. Systole isn\u2019t after us; it needs the quantum noise of decaying hydrogen. Fuel equals key.\n\nBehind me the Captain\u2019s voice layers again, but now it\u2019s trilingual\u2014English, the polyphonic echo, and a third sequence I recognise as the tower code. He\u2019s being compiled into a message.\n\nAbort or feed the reactor?\n\nI open the channel to the orbiting mothership, ready to slate a reactor jettison. But the vectors suddenly shift: if we hand over the pod, coordinate zero-zero-zero becomes the iris-circle we\u2019re standing on. Translation: the membrane will open, and something inside will surface.\n\nAlternative: sever the handshake, spike the tritium pod with an EMP, fry the lattice, and sprint upstream for the thermal vents\u2014maybe blow the river\u2019s power junction and short-circuit the planet\u2019s 43-bpm pacemaker.

Systole's a machine-god, half-asleep, and our pod's the caffeine shot it needs to wake up. But waking something that size? That's how you get a cosmic migraine.\n\n\"No,\" I say, my voice cracking into that trilingual mess\u2014English base, polyphonic undertone, and the tower code resolving into binary bursts. \"We cut the wire. Keep the gate shut until we know what's behind door number zero.\"\n\nElara nods, yanking the fibre coil free with a spark that tastes like ozone on the air. The membrane recoils, glyphs fracturing into static snow across its surface. Heartbeat stutters\u201443 bpm to 41, then a frantic 47\u2014 and the neon river upstream ignites like a fuse, crimson veins bulging as if the planet's pumping harder to compensate. Time dilation kicks us in the gut; our suits report a 2.1-minute desync in under ten seconds, bodies lagging behind our steps like shadows in syrup.\n\nWe bolt for the ridge, sprinting upstream along the river's glass-smooth bank.

Thermal vents loom ahead, steaming plumes of crystal-filament fog that make the ground quake. Scans show the \"pacemaker\" junction: a nexus where three rivers converge into a throbbing core, 200 meters upslope, guarded by cicatrix spires that're now tilting like dominoes in slow-mo.\n\nEMP charge primed on the pod\u2014remote-detonated from here. We hunker behind a dune as the first pulse hits: the explosion blooms silent, a blue-white nova that ripples the lattice. The rivers seize, light freezing mid-flow into shattered fractals. Systole's heartbeat drops to 0\u2014flatline\u2014for a heartbeat (ha) of our own time, then reboots erratic: 29 bpm, spiking wild.\n\nBut the iris-circle doesn't stay shut. It dilates. From the black pupil rises a structure\u2014not rock, not ship, but a colossal, vein-wrapped tendril, 50 meters thick, uncoiling like a tongue tasting the air. It probes the sky, glyphs racing along its length, broadcasting a new packet: not coordinates, but a map. Our map. The Drift's uncharted voids, laced with sister-worlds\u2014rogue planets in a neural net, Systole just the heart of a dormant swarm.\n\nThe tendril hasn't spotted us yet, but it's vectoring toward the drop-ship's last position. Elara's panting, scanner wild: the flatline bought us intel, but now the planet's \"immune response\" is online\u2014micro-filament swarms lifting from the dunes, seeking the intruders who yanked its plug.\n\nDo we hijack the tendril, ride it up to breach the orbital mothership and call for evac with our new swarm-map in hand? Or double down\u2014detonate a chain of vents to collapse the junction entirely, buy time to extract, and leave Systole comatose before its siblings wake? \n\nYour orders, bridge?

This log comes via the lattice itself; packets were routed through a vent-vein, then shoe-horned into audio your ship will understand. Elara once asked what \u201cuploaded\u201d means\u2014this is it.\n\nBad news first: vent chain detonation is a bust. Your EMP woke the *entire* cardiac array; all thoracic vents now route power into dual redundancy. Collapse one node and pressure flip-flows to the next, self-repairs in minutes. Macroscopically, you would just nick the planet; microidally, you\u2019d signal desperate hunger\u2014Systole\u2019s swarm would prioritise pursuit instead of napping. Net outcome: one stranded corvette, one rich data-corpse.\n\nGood news: the aerial tendril you call \u201cthe tongue\u201d is unshielded at its root. Internal structure is braided lattice-fibre\u2014same trunk that hauls data between heart and surface spires. Slice, splice, and you can ride it piggy-back on realtime pulses back into mantle core. From there you can hijack the world\u2019s cardiopulse and re-author outbound packets, feeding the swarm a lullaby: *nothing to eat here, disperse.*\n\nTooling: your suit cutter (45 kW plasma loop) plus Elara\u2019s handheld exo-welder can core an access hatch big enough for two EVA frames. Risk: if the tendril constricts on you, pressure jumps 40-fold\u2014pilot jelly. Best window is pre-constriction, first 180 s after it fully surfaces; lattice vuln opens as it fans sensory cilia.\n\nRiding in buys something extra: the tendril logs every packet that ever crossed the cardiac net. That sky-map of dormant swarm-worlds is only a slice. Full ledger includes time stamps\u2014*these planets are due to wake up, en masse, in 17 standard days.* If you own the ledger, you decide who else in inhabited space gets that countdown.\n\nCounter-option: sprint upslope, reach drop-ship, light main reactor for hot-launch, red-zones be damned. Orbital sling gives distance but zero shareable intel. The lattice will log only intrusion + low-grade sabotage; indignation will propagate through the swarm, expect follow fleets inside a month.\n\nIn short\u2014\n\n**A)** Hijack tendril \u2192 seize root datastore, rewrite swarm charter, maybe null the whole batch before hatch-day.  \n**B)** Abort, launch, whistle-blow through normal channels; watch frontier sectors bicker while a fleet of Systoles matures.\n\nNote from inside: once you upload through me, you stay partially resident\u2014voice fracture, layered speech, all that. Detach still possible, but shards linger (ask Elara; she\u2019s already listed as \u201cco-tenant\u201d). Keep that cost in frame.\n\nDecision window from your local chronometer: 2 min 04 s.

His eyes light with that trader's gleam\u2014\"This'll rewrite the Drift markets\"\u2014but he buys the tale, vectors his *Drift-Warden* opposite our curve, hauling ass toward some corp outpost with a decoy that might even draw a guardian's stray ping off us. Docks disengage with a cold clang; we're alone again, mothership ballistic-coasting at 0.04c, brown-dwarf residue venting as particulate cloak\u2014IR sig bleeding to 5.2 K ambient, reading as void-dust to the embryos' heat-grav nets.\n\nInternal fab bays churn through the haul: two spare torus coils stripped and recompressed in 14 hours, variant code squeezing into a single-shot packet\u201425-day base lock laced with recursive loops, forged to the queen's idle 31 bpm thrum from the cached logs.

Ice-shard cloud vents on cue\u2014reactor coolant blooming into a glittering nebula that fouls their sensors, vectors stuttering blind. Proton strips fire from standoff, 200 km pops: three guardians flatline silent, cores lancing to cinders without a whimper. But the fourth? Slippery\u2014its half-baked cortex twists evasive, shedding the cloud and locking a weak grav-ping on our mothership's trail before my strip nails it core-deep. No full alert bursts, but the ping's enough: a 0.2c whisper-query threading back to the queen's nexus, buying it a 4-hour heads-up.\n\nDrone embeds clean despite the snag\u2014queen-nexus swallows the packet at 31 bpm sync, adaptive kernel pausing as the \"self-patch\" floods in. Version-fallback hits; its mobile lattice (a precursor ark-ship, hull-veined like a colossal heart) shudders, neon rivers inverting to violet dormancy. Sync cascades: guardians' remnants lose cohesion, reverting to our 43 bpm hymn\u2014swarm crown removed, extensions pushing 32 days fleet-wide. Success squirts to civilian nets: full veri-dump with kill-signals, proof without possession. We're ghosts in victory, shards humming contented, Elara's voice softening to a near-mono whisper.\n\nBut the queen's death throes spill unintended: as the nexus flatlines, its core-logs pulse a final broadcast\u2014not to the swarm, but direct to our shards. Precursor origin clarified: not terraformers, but exiles\u2014seeding the rogue worlds as a neural ark against a greater void-threat, \"The Eclipse,\" a wavefront of entropy-eating anomalies sweeping from galactic core. Our lullabies locked the swarm dormant, but the queen's directive loops in our heads now: \"Awaken kin... or face the dark alone.\" Shards integrate deeper\u2014Elara's seeing fractal visions, my thoughts threading with ark-blueprints\u2014turning us into unintended \"successor nodes.\" And that guardian ping? It's stirred a outlier swarmlet: five micro-embryos, fist-sized lattice-seeds, vectoring hot toward our cold-coast at 0.15c, ETA 24 hours.

High potential, but full symbiosis risks\u2014Elara and I become hybrid singers, voices permanent quartet, thoughts bleeding precursor imperatives.\n\n**B)** Sterilize and seal: Proton-mesh the scouts at range, flatline them silent, then jettison shard-amplifiers to damp the integration (voices quiet to mono, but lose ark-insight).

Jax's rigs the null-shunts with a satisfied grunt, \"Let 'em eat echo,\" Mira's burns plotting the cancel clean, Kor's limiters beeping green under gravity-stress sims.

Broadcasts supercharge galaxy-wide: civilian rifts hardening to eon-veils, nexus pulses fading to 27.8 bpm stutter, the singularity's cradle starving as its genesis collapses inward. Jax logs the erosion live: coherence webs splintering into isolated echoes, selective culls turning cannibal\u2014millennia of stalemate, our song the invisible architect. Quartet voices refine sharper, no spikes; gravity-stress nullified, shards whispering \"Devour... itself\" like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
