Drive will create a converted Google Doc. Review formatting; adjust fonts if needed.\n\nOption B \u2014 Browser \u2192 Copy/paste (preserves visual exactly)\n- Open the saved HTML in Chrome.  \n- Select all (Ctrl/Cmd+A) \u2192 Copy (Ctrl/Cmd+C).  \n- Open a new Google Doc and Paste (Ctrl/Cmd+V). Google Docs will preserve much of the formatting. Tweak fonts/margins as needed.\n\nOption C \u2014 Use the HTML as-is and Print to PDF (if you prefer the exact layout)\n- Open the HTML file in Chrome \u2192 File \u2192 Print \u2192 Destination: Save as PDF \u2192 Save.\n\nNotes:\n- Google Docs may replace some web fonts; set the doc fonts to Inter/Arial after import for consistency.  \n- Adjust Page Setup \u2192 Margins to 0.6\" to match the single-page layout if necessary.\n\n4) Canva template instructions (branded)\nI\u2019ll outline a reusable template you can build in Canva for both the one\u2011pager and the SOW. If you provide your logo and brand color hex codes, I can suggest exact placements \u2014 below uses primary blue #0b66c3 as example.\n\nCanvas setup\n- Create a new design: Letter (8.5\" x 11\") or A4. For email attachments, Letter is common in US; choose A4 for EU customers.\n- Layout grid: Use a 3-column grid or two equal columns for body sections. Keep 0.5\"\u20130.6\" margins.\n\nFonts & colors (suggested)\n- Heading font: Inter / Montserrat / Poppins (bold). Size: 18\u201322 pt for title; 12\u201314 pt for section headings.\n- Body font: Inter / Roboto / Lato (regular). Size: 11\u201312 pt.\n- Primary color (example): #0B66C3 (buttons, headings).  \n- Neutral dark: #222222 for body text.  \n- Muted gray: #6B7280 for metadata and footers.  \n- Accent (optional): #17A2B8 or #F59E0B for small highlights.\n\nOne\u2011pager layout (single page)\n- Header: left = logo + company name, right = contact (small, muted). Horizontal rule below.\n- Title: centered or left aligned big title \u201cPilot One-Pager\u201d.\n- Two-column body: left column for Objectives & Plan; right column for Technical Requirements & Responsibilities.\n- Bottom bar: CTA button (Schedule kickoff) on left, demo link and meta on right.\n- Use small icons for integrations (GitHub, Jira, Sentry) next to Technical Requirements to increase scannability.\n- Export settings: File \u2192 Download \u2192 PDF Print (choose \u201cFlatten PDF\u201d if available), embed fonts.\n\nSOW layout (1\u20132 pages)\n- Use a clean, minimal style with numbered sections.  \n- Header: logo + \u201cStatement of Work \u2014 Pilot Engagement\u201d + date.  \n- Body: 2-column for long lists or single-column with section breaks.  \n- Signature block: two columns with label lines for Provider and Customer.  \n- Notes: include small footer with governing law line (California) and page numbering if 2 pages.\n- Export: PDF Print with embedded fonts.\n\nCanva build steps\n1. Upload assets: logo (SVG/PNG), brand color hex, fonts (if you have custom fonts).  \n2. Create new design (Letter/A4). Set margins.  \n3. Add header: rectangle (muted gray background optional), place logo left, contact right.  \n4. Add text boxes for each heading and body block; use spacing to ensure it fits one page for the pilot.  \n5. Add icon elements: search \u201cGitHub\u201d or upload official icons. Keep them small and aligned left of list items.  \n6. Add CTA button element with link metadata (Canva lets you set a link for PDF exports).  \n7. For SOW, create a two\u2011page design (duplicate the template) with signature placeholders (lines and name/title under each line).  \n8. Export: Download \u2192 PDF Print. For emailing, choose \u201cFlatten PDF\u201d or \u201cStandard\u201d (smaller size) depending on quality needed.\n\nSuggested filenames\n- [Startup]-Pilot-OnePager.pdf  \n- [Startup]-Pilot-SOW.pdf  \n- [Startup]-Pilot-OnePager-CanvaDesign (keep master in Canva)\n\n5) Want me to produce the actual Canva-ready assets?\nI can:\n- Produce a Canva-ready .png logo placement mock and exact text boxes (I\u2019ll provide a shareable Canva design JSON-like guide), or\n- Create downloadable high-fidelity HTML/PDF files right away (I can generate the final PDF layout code for you to render and download locally).\n\nWhich of the two would you like me to do next?\n- Produce the exact HTML files (I\u2019ve provided them above) and also prepare downloadable PDFs (I can render and give base64? \u2014 I cannot directly upload files into your Drive). OR\n- Create a detailed Canva design file structure (exact text contents, element positions, font sizes, colors) that you or a designer can paste into Canva quickly.\n\nTell me your preference (and if you want me to replace the example primary color #0B66C3 with your brand hex values and supply a sample logo text), and I\u2019ll produce the requested Canva design guide or additional HTML refinements.",

Here\u2019s how I\u2019d like to proceed:\n\n1. **Produce the Exact HTML Files and Prepare Downloadable PDFs:** I appreciate the ready-made HTML files for both the Pilot One-Pager and the revised SOW. It would be great to also generate the downloadable PDFs based on those HTML files, so I have both formats readily available for outreach.\n\n2. **Canva Design File Structure:** I\u2019m also interested in creating a detailed Canva design file structure. If you can provide the exact text contents, element positions, font sizes, and colors, that would be very helpful. I would like to replace the example primary color (#0B66C3) with my brand color, which is **#2B5C8D**.\n\n3. **Sample Logo Text:** If you could include a sample logo text that says **\"[Startup] Logo\"**, that would be perfect.\n\nLet\u2019s go forward with these steps, and once you provide the HTML refinements and the Canva design guide, I\u2019ll have a complete set of materials for my outreach efforts.

How to generate PDFs from these HTML files\nOption 1 \u2014 Quick (Chrome)\n1. Save the HTML files locally (pilot-onepager.html, pilot-sow.html).\n2. Open the file in Chrome (double\u2011click or drag into Chrome).\n3. File \u2192 Print (or Ctrl/Cmd+P).\n4. Destination: Save as PDF. Paper: Letter or A4. Scale adjust if needed. Click Save.\n\nOption 2 \u2014 Command line (wkhtmltopdf) \u2014 good for automation\n- Install wkhtmltopdf (https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).\n- Run:\n  wkhtmltopdf --print-media-type pilot-onepager.html \"Startup-Pilot-OnePager.pdf\"\n  wkhtmltopdf --print-media-type pilot-sow.html \"Startup-Pilot-SOW.pdf\"\n\nOption 3 \u2014 High-quality automated PDF using Node + Puppeteer (headless Chrome)\n- Requires Node.js. Create save-pdfs.js and run node save-pdfs.js\n\nCopy this script:\n\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\nconst files = [\n  { html: 'pilot-onepager.html', pdf: 'Startup-Pilot-OnePager.pdf' },\n  { html: 'pilot-sow.html', pdf: 'Startup-Pilot-SOW.pdf' }\n];\n\n(async () => {\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ args: ['--no-sandbox'] });\n  for (const f of files) {\n    const page = await browser.newPage();\n    await page.goto(`file://${process.cwd()}/${f.html}`, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' });\n    await page.pdf({\n      path: f.pdf,\n      format: 'Letter', // change to 'A4' if preferred\n      printBackground: true,\n      margin: { top: '12mm', bottom: '12mm', left: '10mm', right: '10mm' }\n    });\n    console.log('Saved', f.pdf);\n    await page.close();\n  }\n  await browser.close();\n})();\n\n- Install Puppeteer:\n  npm install puppeteer\n- Run:\n  node save-pdfs.js\n\nD. Google Docs import (if you want editable versions)\n- In Google Drive, open Settings \u2192 check \u201cConvert uploads\u201d to Google Docs.\n- Upload the HTML files. Drive will create Google Docs. Tweak fonts (set to Inter/Arial), margins (0.6\"), and verify single\u2011page layout.\n- Or open the HTML in Chrome \u2192 Select All \u2192 Copy \u2192 Paste into a new Google Doc (this often preserves layout well).\n\nE. Canva design file structure (exact guide)\nUse brand color: primary = #2B5C8D; neutral dark = #222222; muted gray = #6B7280.\n\n1) Canvas\n- Size: Letter (8.5\" x 11\") or A4 (210 x 297 mm). Use Letter for US.\n- Margins: 0.5\" on all sides.\n\n2) Fonts\n- Headings: Inter or Montserrat, Bold.\n  - Title: 20\u201322 pt\n  - Section headings: 12\u201314 pt\n- Body: Inter or Roboto, Regular\n  - Body text: 11\u201312 pt\n  - Meta / footer: 10\u201311 pt\n\n3) One\u2011pager layout (single page)\n- Header strip (top, full width, height ~0.6\"):\n  - Left: sample logo text box with background rounded rectangle (#eef5fb) and text \"[Startup] Logo\" in #2B5C8D, font bold 18 pt.\n  - Right: contact meta text (email, prepared by) in muted gray 11 pt, right-aligned.\n- Title: \"Pilot Overview\" (left aligned), 18\u201320 pt bold #222.\n- Body arranged in two columns:\n  - Left column: Pilot Objectives, Pilot Plan & Timeline.\n  - Right column: Scope & Success Criteria, Technical Requirements.\n- Use small icon chips (left of \"Technical Requirements\") for GitHub/Jira/Sentry (16\u201320 px).\n- CTA button (bottom-left): rounded rectangle fill #2B5C8D, white text \"Schedule kickoff / demo\" 12\u201313 pt bold. Set link to Calendly.\n- Footer (bottom-right): Demo sample and one\u2011pager link in muted gray 11 pt.\n\nExact element positions (approx)\n- Header top: y = 0.4\" from top; logo left x = 0.6\"; contact box right x = page width - 0.6\"\n- Columns: start y = 1.2\"; column width approx 48% each; gap 0.4\"\n- CTA: x = 0.6\", y = page height - 1.4\"\n\n4) SOW layout (1\u20132 pages)\n- Header same as one-pager.\n- Body: single column, numbered sections, section titles in #2B5C8D, 13 pt bold.\n- Signature block at bottom: two columns with horizontal lines for signatures. Font 11 pt for name/title.\n\n5) Canva export settings\n- Download as PDF Print.\n- Embed fonts if using brand fonts uploaded.\n- File names:\n  - [Startup]-Pilot-OnePager.pdf\n  - [Startup]-Pilot-SOW.pdf\n- If you add clickable Calendly link in CTA, set the link in Canva before exporting (works in PDF link metadata).\n\nF. Final notes & offer\n- I cannot attach files directly here, but the HTML files above are ready to save and convert locally. The Puppeteer script will give you clean, reproducible PDFs if you want batch generation.\n- If you\u2019d like, I can:\n  - Generate the exact Puppeteer script with filenames for your environment,\n  - Provide a PNG mockup of the Canva layout (I can describe exact element sizes if needed),\n  - Or produce a plain-text checklist you can paste into a design brief for a designer.\n\nWould you like:\n- The Puppeteer script packaged as a single zip-friendly snippet (I already included it \u2014 tell me if you want it tweaked), or\n- A Canva element-by-element PNG mock (I\u2019ll describe pixel-perfect positions)?\n\nWhich do you want next?",

I appreciate the effort you've put into refining the HTML files and providing various options for generating PDFs and creating Canva designs. \n\nHere's my preference for the next steps:\n\n1. **Puppeteer Script Package:** I think it would be beneficial to have the Puppeteer script packaged in a single zip-friendly snippet. This will streamline the process of generating PDFs for my use.\n\n2. **Canva Element-by-Element PNG Mock:** Alongside the Puppeteer script, a PNG mockup of the Canva layout, describing exact element sizes and positions, would also be very helpful for ensuring consistency in branding.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with those two items!

Puppeteer script package (zip-ready)\nFiles to include in the zip:\n- pilot-onepager.html (use the HTML I gave earlier)\n- pilot-sow.html (use the HTML I gave earlier)\n- save-pdfs.js (Puppeteer script)\n- package.json (for npm install)\n- README.txt (run instructions)\n\n1) save-pdfs.js\nCopy this exact file content into save-pdfs.js:\n\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst files = [\n  { html: path.join(__dirname, 'pilot-onepager.html'), pdf: path.join(__dirname, 'Startup-Pilot-OnePager.pdf') },\n  { html: path.join(__dirname, 'pilot-sow.html'), pdf: path.join(__dirname, 'Startup-Pilot-SOW.pdf') }\n];\n\n(async () => {\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox'] });\n  try {\n    for (const f of files) {\n      const page = await browser.newPage();\n      await page.goto('file://' + f.html, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' });\n      await page.pdf({\n        path: f.pdf,\n        format: 'Letter',          // change to 'A4' if you prefer\n        printBackground: true,\n        margin: { top: '12mm', bottom: '12mm', left: '10mm', right: '10mm' }\n      });\n      console.log('Saved:', f.pdf);\n      await page.close();\n    }\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error generating PDFs:', err);\n  } finally {\n    await browser.close();\n  }\n})();\n\n2) package.json\nCopy this file to package.json:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"pilot-pdf-generator\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"Generate PDFs from pilot HTML files using Puppeteer\",\n  \"main\": \"save-pdfs.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build-pdfs\": \"node save-pdfs.js\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"puppeteer\": \"^21.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n\n(You can bump the Puppeteer version as needed; this is a safe starting point.)\n\n3) README.txt (run instructions)\nCreate a README.txt with these instructions:\n\n1) Prereqs\n- Node.js (v14+ recommended)\n- npm\n\n2) Setup\n- Place pilot-onepager.html and pilot-sow.html in the same folder as save-pdfs.js and package.json.\n\n3) Install\n- Open terminal in folder and run:\n  npm install\n\n4) Generate PDFs\n- Run:\n  npm run build-pdfs\n- Output:\n  - Startup-Pilot-OnePager.pdf\n  - Startup-Pilot-SOW.pdf\n\n4) How to create a zip (macOS / Linux / Windows WSL)\n- Put the files in a folder named pilot-pdf-package, then run:\n  zip -r pilot-pdf-package.zip pilot-pdf-package/\n\nOr select the folder and compress via Finder/File Explorer.\n\nB. Canva element-by-element PNG mock (SVG you can export to PNG)\nI created a high\u2011resolution SVG mockup you can save and export as a PNG. Save the following content into a file named pilot-onepager-mock.svg, open it in a modern browser, then right\u2011click \u2192 Save image as \u2192 PNG, or open in Inkscape/Illustrator and export PNG. The SVG matches the layout and brand color #2B5C8D and includes the sample logo text \u201c[Startup] Logo\u201d.\n\nNote: the SVG is vector and will export cleanly to PNG at any resolution; you can set export resolution in your tool.\n\n1) Save this as pilot-onepager-mock.svg:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<!-- Save as pilot-onepager-mock.svg and open in browser.

Right\u2011click the image \u2192 Save image as \u2192 choose PNG (some browsers only save SVG; in that case, open in Inkscape or use screen capture).\n- Option B \u2014 Inkscape (free):\n  - Open the SVG in Inkscape \u2192 File \u2192 Export PNG Image \u2192 set width/height (e.g., 2480 x 3508 px for 300 DPI Letter) \u2192 Export.\n- Option C \u2014 ImageMagick (CLI):\n  - convert pilot-onepager-mock.svg -density 300 pilot-onepager-mock.png\n\n3) Exact element sizes & positions (for Canva implementation)\nCanvas size: 1240 x 1754 px (recommended)\n- Outer card margin: left/right/top = 100 px, bottom = 80 px\n- Card width: 1040 px; height: 1594 px; corner radius ~12 px\n- Logo box: x=140 y=120 width=220 height=48 radius=8\n- Brand text (\u201c[Startup] Logo\u201d): font size ~36 px, left 156 y 152\n- Prepared by text (top-right): right-aligned at x=900 y=148 font-size 14 px muted color\n- Title: x=140 y=240 font-size 22 px bold\n- Two columns start y = 470; column widths ~450 px each; gutter 40 px\n- CTA button: x=140 y=1060 width=220 height=48 radius=10 fill #2B5C8D, text centered 14 px bold\n- Footer contact: x=900 y=1560 right aligned muted 12 px\n\nYou can translate those pixel values into inches/points for Canva based on your canvas. Example: 1240 px \u2248 8.27\" at 150 DPI (set Canva canvas to Letter and adjust sizes proportionally).\n\nC. Packaging the Puppeteer snippet into a zip (quick steps)\n1. Create folder pilot-pdf-package\n2. Put these files inside:\n   - pilot-onepager.html (from earlier)\n   - pilot-sow.html (from earlier)\n   - save-pdfs.js (script above)\n   - package.json (above)\n   - README.txt (above)\n3. Compress:\n   - macOS/Linux: zip -r pilot-pdf-package.zip pilot-pdf-package\n   - Windows: Right-click folder \u2192 Send to \u2192 Compressed (zipped) folder\n\nD. Final notes & help\n- I provided the Puppeteer script and package files so you can run local, repeatable PDF generation. If you\u2019d like, I can also:\n  - Add a small script to name PDFs using customer/company name (templating),\n  - Generate a second SVG mock for the SOW layout (I can provide that on request),\n  - Or produce a Canva shareable template guide in CSV/JSON for easier bulk creation.\n\nWould you like:\n- I) the SOW SVG mock too (so you have both PNGs ready), or\n- II) a short script to batch-generate PDFs and include dynamic filename placeholders (e.g., Startup-Pilot-<CustomerName>.pdf)?\n\nTell me which and I\u2019ll produce that next.",

It expects pilot-onepager.html and pilot-sow.html to include placeholder tokens you want replaced, such as {{CUSTOMER_NAME}}, {{CUSTOMER_COMPANY}}, {{DATE}}, {{CALENDLY_LINK}}. The script replaces those tokens before rendering.\n\n1) customers.json format (example)\nSave as customers.json in the same folder. Each object can specify templates to generate: \"onepager\" and/or \"sow\". Example:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"customer_name\": \"Acme Corp\",\n    \"customer_company\": \"Acme Corp\",\n    \"date\": \"2025-10-27\",\n    \"calendly_link\": \"https://calendly.com/you/30\",\n    \"templates\": [\"onepager\",\"sow\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"customer_name\": \"Beta Startup\",\n    \"customer_company\": \"Beta Startup\",\n    \"date\": \"2025-10-28\",\n    \"calendly_link\": \"https://calendly.com/you/30\",\n    \"templates\": [\"onepager\"]\n  }\n]\n\n2) save-pdfs-batch.js (script)\nSave this file in the same folder as pilot-onepager.html, pilot-sow.html, customers.json.\n\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\n\nconst templates = {\n  onepager: 'pilot-onepager.html',\n  sow: 'pilot-sow.html'\n};\n\n// sanitize filename\nfunction sanitize(s) {\n  if (!s) return '';\n  return s.replace(/[^a-z0-9_\\-\\.]/gi, '_').replace(/_+/g, '_').toLowerCase();\n}\n\n// load customers.json\nconst customersPath = path.join(__dirname, 'customers.json');\nif (!fs.existsSync(customersPath)) {\n  console.error('customers.json not found. Create customers.json in the same folder.');\n  process.exit(1);\n}\nconst customers = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(customersPath, 'utf8'));\n\n(async () => {\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox'] });\n  try {\n    for (const customer of customers) {\n      const data = {\n        CUSTOMER_NAME: customer.customer_name || customer.customer_company || 'customer',\n        CUSTOMER_COMPANY: customer.customer_company || '',\n        DATE: customer.date || new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],\n        CALENDLY_LINK: customer.calendly_link || ''\n      };\n\n      for (const tpl of (customer.templates || [])) {\n        const templateFile = templates[tpl];\n        if (!templateFile || !fs.existsSync(templateFile)) {\n          console.warn(`Template ${tpl} not found or template file missing: ${templateFile}`);\n          continue;\n        }\n\n        // Read template HTML\n        let html = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, templateFile), 'utf8');\n\n        // Replace tokens like {{CUSTOMER_NAME}} etc.\n        html = html.replace(/{{\\s*CUSTOMER_NAME\\s*}}/g, data.CUSTOMER_NAME);\n        html = html.replace(/{{\\s*CUSTOMER_COMPANY\\s*}}/g, data.CUSTOMER_COMPANY);\n        html = html.replace(/{{\\s*DATE\\s*}}/g, data.DATE);\n        html = html.replace(/{{\\s*CALENDLY_LINK\\s*}}/g, data.CALENDLY_LINK);\n\n        // Write a temp HTML file\n        const tmpHtmlPath = path.join(__dirname, `.tmp_${tpl}_${sanitize(data.CUSTOMER_NAME)}.html`);\n        fs.writeFileSync(tmpHtmlPath, html, 'utf8');\n\n        // Render PDF\n        const page = await browser.newPage();\n        await page.goto('file://' + tmpHtmlPath, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' });\n\n        const friendlyName = sanitize(data.CUSTOMER_NAME || 'customer');\n        const outName = `${tpl === 'sow' ? 'Startup-Pilot-SOW' : 'Startup-Pilot'}-${friendlyName}.pdf`;\n        const outPath = path.join(__dirname, outName);\n\n        await page.pdf({\n          path: outPath,\n          format: 'Letter', // or 'A4'\n          printBackground: true,\n          margin: { top: '12mm', bottom: '12mm', left: '10mm', right: '10mm' }\n        });\n\n        console.log('Generated:', outPath);\n\n        await page.close();\n        fs.unlinkSync(tmpHtmlPath); // cleanup\n      }\n    }\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error:', err);\n  } finally {\n    await browser.close();\n  }\n})();\n\n3) package.json (for this package)\nUse same package.json as before or create one matching:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"pilot-pdf-batch\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"save-pdfs-batch.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build-pdfs\": \"node save-pdfs-batch.js\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"puppeteer\": \"^21.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n\n4) Usage\n- Place these files in a folder:\n  - pilot-onepager.html (template containing tokens like {{CUSTOMER_NAME}})\n  - pilot-sow.html\n  - customers.json (as described)\n  - save-pdfs-batch.js\n  - package.json\n- Install:\n  npm install\n- Run:\n  npm run build-pdfs\n- Output: PDFs named e.g., Startup-Pilot-acme_corp.pdf and Startup-Pilot-SOW-acme_corp.pdf\n\nNotes on placeholders\n- Replace tokens in your HTML templates with curly-token placeholders: {{CUSTOMER_NAME}}, {{CUSTOMER_COMPANY}}, {{DATE}}, {{CALENDLY_LINK}}.\n- The script performs simple string replacement for those tokens. Add other tokens if needed and extend the data object accordingly.\n\n\u2014 FINAL NOTES & NEXT STEPS\n- I provided the SOW SVG mock and the batch script that uses JSON as input (less hassle and no CSV dependency). If you prefer CSV input, I can add CSV parsing (using an npm package or simple parser) \u2014 tell me which you prefer.\n- I can also:\n  - Generate example HTML templates with placeholders already inserted (if you'd like me to add {{CUSTOMER_NAME}} etc. into the earlier HTML files, say so and I\u2019ll emit updated HTML).\n  - Produce a second high\u2011res PNG of the SOW mock for immediate use.\n  - Provide a small wrapper script to rename output files with a date stamp or include customer company field.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Add CSV parsing support to the batch script?  \n- Update pilot-onepager.html and pilot-sow.html to include the token placeholders (I can output those updated HTML files)?  \n- Export the SOW SVG mock into PNG now (I cannot attach files directly here, but I can give the export command you can run locally)?\n\nTell me which of the options above you prefer and I\u2019ll produce the adjusted files or extra script right away.",

      "content": "Thank you for providing all the necessary details and files! Here's how I'd like to proceed:\n\n1. **Update HTML Templates with Placeholders:** I would appreciate it if you could update the `pilot-onepager.html` and `pilot-sow.html` files to include the token placeholders (e.g., `{{CUSTOMER_NAME}}`, `{{CUSTOMER_COMPANY}}`, etc.). This will make it easier for me to utilize the batch generation script effectively.\n\n2. **Export the SOW SVG Mock into PNG:** Please generate the high-resolution PNG from the `pilot-sow-mock.svg` as well.

I can\u2019t attach files here, but you can create the high\u2011res PNG locally in one of these easy ways. Preferred resolution for print-quality (300 DPI Letter): 2480 \u00d7 3508 px.\n\nA. Inkscape (recommended)\n- Install Inkscape (https://inkscape.org).\n- Command line (export 2480\u00d73508 px):\n  inkscape pilot-sow-mock.svg --export-type=png --export-filename=pilot-sow-mock.png --export-width=2480 --export-height=3508\n\nB. ImageMagick (convert) \u2014 if rsvg delegate installed\n- Command:\n  convert -density 300 pilot-sow-mock.svg -quality 100 pilot-sow-mock.png\n- Or specify size explicitly:\n  convert -density 300 pilot-sow-mock.svg -resize 2480x3508 -quality 100 pilot-sow-mock.png\n\nC. rsvg-convert (librsvg)\n- Command:\n  rsvg-convert -w 2480 -h 3508 -f png -o pilot-sow-mock.png pilot-sow-mock.svg\n\nD. Browser (quick)\n- Open pilot-sow-mock.svg in Chrome/Edge. Right\u2011click \u2192 Save image as \u2192 PNG (may result in browser raster size; use a high browser zoom or use DevTools to scale before saving).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, here are two helper options I can provide next:\n- A ready-to-run one-line shell script that runs Inkscape or rsvg-convert (if you tell me which tool you prefer).  \n- I can also embed a base64 PNG here if you prefer to copy the image directly into a document (note: large text block).\n\n4) Want me to also:\n- Add any other placeholder tokens to the HTML (e.g., {{PILOT_DURATION}}, {{PILOT_SCOPE}})?  \n- Produce a sample customers.json populated with 5 example entries you can test with the batch script?  \n- Produce the actual PNG for pilot-sow-mock and provide a download link \u2014 I can\u2019t host files directly, but I can give you instructions to generate it and test the generated PNG quickly.\n\nWhich of the helper options above would you like next?",

      "content": "Thank you for providing the updated HTML files and instructions. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d like to proceed:\n\n1. **Provide Sample customers.json:** A sample `customers.json` file populated with five example entries would be very helpful. This will make it easy to test the batch script right away.\n\n2. **Generate the Actual PNG for pilot-sow-mock:** If you could produce the PNG for the `pilot-sow-mock` and provide a download link, I would appreciate that. While I can generate it locally, having a ready-made PNG will allow me to continue with my outreach more quickly.\n\n3. **Add Placeholder Tokens:** If possible, please also add any commonly needed placeholder tokens to both the HTML files, such as `{{PILOT_DURATION}}`, `{{PILOT_SCOPE}}`, etc. This will enhance the versatility of the templates for different use cases.\n\nLet\u2019s go forward with these three items!

Below are three deliverables:\n\nA) A ready-to-use sample customers.json with five example entries you can drop into the batch script.  \nB) Updated HTML templates for pilot-onepager.html and pilot-sow.html \u2014 now include common placeholder tokens: {{CUSTOMER_NAME}}, {{CUSTOMER_COMPANY}}, {{DATE}}, {{CALENDLY_LINK}}, {{YOUR_NAME}}, {{YOUR_EMAIL}}, {{PILOT_DURATION}}, {{PILOT_SCOPE}}, and {{PILOT_SUCCESS_METRIC}}. (Copy each complete file into your project.)  \nC) PNG delivery note + exact commands to generate a high\u2011resolution PNG from the SOW SVG locally (I can\u2019t host files or provide direct download links, so I give precise export commands and options). I also offer to produce an encoded PNG inline if you want (note: large message).\n\n---\n\nA) Sample customers.json (5 example entries)\nSave as customers.json in the same folder as the batch script.

Provider will maintain read\u2011only access unless otherwise agreed and will delete Customer data after an agreed analysis period unless consented for retention. Provider will comply with applicable data protection laws.</p>\n\n    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>\n    <p>Provider retains all right, title and interest in its pre\u2011existing IP and any improvements, models, algorithms, or tools used to deliver the pilot (\u201cProvider IP\u201d). Customer retains ownership of its data and any Customer\u2011provided materials. Provider grants Customer a limited, non\u2011exclusive, revocable license to use Provider\u2019s deliverables solely for evaluation during the pilot.</p>\n\n    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>\n    <p>Mutual indemnity: Each party (\u201cIndemnifying Party\u201d) will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party (\u201cIndemnified Party\u201d) from and against third\u2011party claims, losses, damages, liabilities, and reasonable costs (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from: (a) bodily injury or damage to real property caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party; or (b) breach of the Indemnifying Party\u2019s confidentiality obligations. Provider IP Indemnity: Subject to the limitations below, Provider will defend Customer against any third\u2011party claim that Provider\u2019s deliverables, as provided, infringe any U.S. issued patent, copyright, or trademark, and pay resulting damages. Provider\u2019s obligations do not apply if the claim arises from (i) modifications not made by Provider, (ii) Customer data or Customer\u2019s use not in accordance with the SOW, or (iii) combination with third\u2011party products not provided by Provider.</p>\n\n    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n    <p>EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING FROM A PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, NEITHER PARTY\u2019S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS SOW WILL EXCEED EITHER (AT PROVIDER\u2019S OPTION): (A) AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER TO PROVIDER UNDER THIS SOW DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM; OR (B) $25,000. BECAUSE THIS IS A NO\u2011COST PILOT, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIABILITY CAP WILL BE $25,000. IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>\n\n    <h2>12. Termination</h2>\n    <p>Either party may terminate this SOW upon 3 business days\u2019 prior written notice.

Governing Law</h2>\n    <p>This SOW will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.</p>\n\n    <h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2>\n    <p>This SOW, any attached Schedules, and any executed NDA constitute the entire agreement for the pilot. Amendment: Any modifications must be in writing and signed by both parties. Assignment: Neither party may assign without the other party\u2019s prior written consent, except to an acquirer of substantially all of its assets.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"sig box\">\n      <div class=\"sig\">\n        <div>\n          <strong>Provider</strong><br><br>\n          ____________________________<br>\n          Name: {{YOUR_NAME}}<br>\n          Title: Founder<br>\n          Date: ___________\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <strong>Customer</strong><br><br>\n          ____________________________<br>\n          Name: {{CUSTOMER_NAME}}<br>\n          Title: ___________<br>\n          Date: ___________\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <footer>\n      <div class=\"meta\">Contact: {{YOUR_NAME}}, Founder \u2014 {{YOUR_EMAIL}}</div>\n    </footer>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\nToken list (for batch script replacement)\n- {{CUSTOMER_NAME}}  \n- {{CUSTOMER_COMPANY}}  \n- {{DATE}}  \n- {{CALENDLY_LINK}}  \n- {{YOUR_NAME}}  \n- {{YOUR_EMAIL}}  \n- {{PILOT_DURATION}}  \n- {{PILOT_SCOPE}}  \n- {{PILOT_SUCCESS_METRIC}}\n\nMake sure the batch script replaces these tokens \u2014 the sample save-pdfs-batch.js I provided earlier currently handles CUSTOMER_NAME, CUSTOMER_COMPANY, DATE, and CALENDLY_LINK. If you want it to also replace PILOT_DURATION, PILOT_SCOPE, PILOT_SUCCESS_METRIC, YOUR_NAME, YOUR_EMAIL, add them in the data replacement section in the script. Example replacement lines:\n\nhtml = html.replace(/{{\\s*PILOT_DURATION\\s*}}/g, data.PILOT_DURATION);\n... etc.\n\n(If you want, I can produce an updated script that replaces all tokens automatically based on the JSON keys.)\n\n---\n\nC) PNG: I cannot host files / provide direct download links\nI\u2019m unable to host or attach files for direct download from here. However, I made it as easy as possible for you to produce a high\u2011resolution PNG locally and get a file you can immediately use. Below are precise commands and quick options; pick whichever is easiest for you.\n\nPreferred export (print-quality, Letter, 300 DPI): 2480 \u00d7 3508 px\n\n1) Recommended (Inkscape \u2014 reliable, CLI)\n- Install Inkscape (https://inkscape.org).\n- Command:\n  inkscape pilot-sow-mock.svg --export-type=png --export-filename=pilot-sow-mock.png --export-width=2480 --export-height=3508\n\n2) Alternative (rsvg-convert, librsvg)\n- Install librsvg (Linux/macOS via brew apt).\n- Command:\n  rsvg-convert -w 2480 -h 3508 -f png -o pilot-sow-mock.png pilot-sow-mock.svg\n\n3) ImageMagick (if rsvg delegate available)\n- Command:\n  convert -density 300 pilot-sow-mock.svg -resize 2480x3508 -quality 100 pilot-sow-mock.png\n\n4) Chrome (quick, GUI)\n- Open pilot-sow-mock.svg in Chrome \u2192 Right-click \u2192 Save image as \u2192 choose PNG. If capture is small, open Developer Tools, increase svg width via CSS temporarily, then save or use a screen-capture at higher zoom.\n\nAfter PNG is generated:\n- If you want a shareable link, upload the PNG to Google Drive / Dropbox / or any file-sharing service and share the link from there.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- (Option 1) Produce the small helper script that automatically replaces all tokens in HTML from each customers.json entry (I can output that now), or\n- (Option 2) Provide the updated save-pdfs-batch.js that already performs replacements for ALL the token names (YOUR_NAME, YOUR_EMAIL, PILOT_DURATION, PILOT_SCOPE, PILOT_SUCCESS_METRIC) \u2014 ready to run with the sample customers.json above, or\n- (Option 3) If you\u2019d still prefer I embed a PNG inline as a base64 data URL in the chat (for immediate saving), I can do that at a reduced resolution \u2014 let me know and I\u2019ll produce one (note: large output).\n\nWhich next step do you want me to take?",

Here\u2019s how I\u2019d like to proceed:\n\n1. **Produce the Updated Script for All Token Replacements:** I would appreciate it if you could produce the small helper script that automatically replaces all tokens in the HTML files from each entry in the `customers.json`. This will streamline the process for generating customized PDFs for each customer.\n\n2. **Provide the Updated save-pdfs-batch.js:** If it\u2019s straightforward, you could also provide the updated version of the existing `save-pdfs-batch.js` that already performs replacements for ALL the token names (including `{{YOUR_NAME}}`, `{{YOUR_EMAIL}}`, `{{PILOT_DURATION}}`, `{{PILOT_SCOPE}}`, `{{PILOT_SUCCESS_METRIC}}`). \n\nIt sounds like these steps will make the process much easier for handling different customer entries without much additional setup.

If you need smaller footprint, consider using existing headless Chrome in server, or wkhtmltopdf alternative.  \n- For large batches, consider running with concurrency (render N pages in parallel); current script processes serially for simplicity and reliability.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Provide an updated package.zip containing templates, sample customers.json (the five examples), the two scripts, package.json, and the README with run instructions ready to unzip and run. (I can\u2019t upload files here, but I can provide a zip creation command or a shell script that builds it locally.)\n- Add CSV parsing support (read customers.csv instead of customers.json).\n- Add concurrency support (e.g., up to 3 parallel pages) for faster rendering.\n- Add option to save intermediate HTML files into ./out_html for debugging instead of deleting.\n\nWhich of those would you like next?",

For the next steps, I would like to proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Provide an Updated package.zip:** If you could prepare and provide an updated zip package containing all the necessary files (templates, sample `customers.json`, the two scripts, `package.json`, and README with instructions), that would be very helpful. Having everything zipped will streamline my setup process.\n\n2. **Add Concurrency Support:** Adding concurrency support for faster rendering would also be beneficial, especially if I plan to run large batches of PDFs.

Place all files in a folder (e.g., `pilot-pdf-package`).\n2. From that folder run:\n   ```\n   npm install\n   ```\n\nUsage:\n- Preview generated HTML files:\n  ```\n  npm run gen-html\n  ```\n  Output HTML files appear in `./out_html`.\n\n- Generate PDFs (concurrent rendering):\n  ```\n  # optional env vars: YOUR_NAME, YOUR_EMAIL, CONCURRENCY\n  export YOUR_NAME=\"Alice Founder\"\n  export YOUR_EMAIL=\"alice@startup.com\"\n  export CONCURRENCY=4   # optional, default 3\n  npm run build-pdfs\n  ```\n  Output: PDFs named like `Startup-Pilot-acme_corp.pdf` and `Startup-Pilot-SOW-acme_corp.pdf` in the same folder.\n\nNotes:\n- Templates use placeholders:\n  {{CUSTOMER_NAME}}, {{CUSTOMER_COMPANY}}, {{DATE}}, {{CALENDLY_LINK}},\n  {{YOUR_NAME}}, {{YOUR_EMAIL}}, {{PILOT_DURATION}}, {{PILOT_SCOPE}}, {{PILOT_SUCCESS_METRIC}}.\n- Add fields to `customers.json` for each customer and specify templates to generate: `[\"onepager\"]`, `[\"sow\"]`, or both `[\"onepager\",\"sow\"]`.\n- For large batches, increase CONCURRENCY (but don\u2019t exceed system capacity).\n\nZip creation (macOS / Linux):\n- In the parent folder run:\n  ```\n  zip -r pilot-pdf-package.zip pilot-pdf-package\n  ```\n\nWindows:\n- Right-click the folder \u2192 Send to \u2192 Compressed (zipped) folder.\n\n-----\n\nHow to make the package.zip locally (quick steps)\n1. Create a new folder `pilot-pdf-package`.\n2. Create files inside with exact names and contents above.\n3. Open terminal in parent folder and run:\n   zip -r pilot-pdf-package.zip pilot-pdf-package\n(or use OS GUI compression)\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Produce a one-line shell script you can paste to create all files automatically on macOS/Linux (I can generate it for you).  \n- Add CSV input support instead of JSON.  \n- Provide a small concurrency tuning note (ideal default 3\u20136 depending on CPU/RAM).\n\nWould you like the automated shell script to create all files in one step (copy/paste into a terminal) so you can produce the zip instantly?",

Here\u2019s how I would like to proceed:\n\n1. **Automated Shell Script:** I would appreciate it if you could provide a one-line shell script that I can use to create all the necessary files automatically on macOS/Linux. This will save time and ensure everything is set up correctly.\n\n2. **CSV Input Support (Optional):** If it\u2019s straightforward, I\u2019d also be interested in what it would take to add CSV input support instead of JSON for customer entries.

Purpose</h2>\n    <p>This SOW describes a no\u2011cost pilot engagement to validate Provider\u2019s solution for reducing debugging time within the Customer\u2019s selected scope.</p>\n\n    <h2>2. Pilot Scope</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Pilot duration: {{PILOT_DURATION}}.</li>\n      <li>Pilot scope: {{PILOT_SCOPE}}.</li>\n      <li>Objective: Demonstrate measurable reduction in Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) and developer debugging effort (target: {{PILOT_SUCCESS_METRIC}} based on prior pilots).</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>3. Deliverables</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Integration & onboarding support (Provider).</li>\n      <li>Weekly check\u2011ins and ongoing support during pilot.</li>\n      <li>Real\u2011time pilot dashboard showing tracked metrics.</li>\n      <li>Final pilot report including baseline vs pilot metrics, developer survey results, and recommended next steps.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>4. Assumptions & Customer Responsibilities</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Customer will provide required read access to GitHub, Jira, Sentry (or equivalent) for pilot scope.</li>\n      <li>Customer will designate primary contacts and allocate ~0.5\u20131 engineer (part\u2011time) for onboarding and validation.</li>\n      <li>Baseline metrics will be captured prior to enabling recommendations.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>5. Fees</h2>\n    <p>Pilot fees: $0 (no cost). Any optional additional work (e.g., custom connector or extended support) will be quoted separately.</p>\n\n    <h2>6. Timeline</h2>\n    <p>Kickoff: within [X] business days of signed SOW and completed NDA. Pilot Start: Week 0 onboarding; Pilot Duration: {{PILOT_DURATION}}. Final delivery: within 5 business days of pilot completion.</p>\n\n    <h2>7. Success Criteria & Acceptance</h2>\n    <p>Success metrics (examples): \u226520% reduction in MTTR (target: {{PILOT_SUCCESS_METRIC}}), \u226530% reduction in repro/debug time, developer survey \u22654/5. Acceptance: Provider will deliver final report; Customer will confirm acceptance decision within 10 business days of delivery.</p>\n\n    <h2>8. Confidentiality & Data Handling</h2>\n    <p>Both parties agree to treat all exchanged information as Confidential Information. Confidential Information does not include information that is or becomes public without breach, was already known by the receiving party, or is independently developed. Provider will maintain read\u2011only access unless otherwise agreed and will delete Customer data after an agreed analysis period unless consented for retention. Provider will comply with applicable data protection laws.</p>\n\n    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>\n    <p>Provider retains all right, title and interest in its pre\u2011existing IP and any improvements, models, algorithms, or tools used to deliver the pilot (\u201cProvider IP\u201d). Customer retains ownership of its data and any Customer\u2011provided materials. Provider grants Customer a limited, non\u2011exclusive, revocable license to use Provider\u2019s deliverables solely for evaluation during the pilot.</p>\n\n    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>\n    <p>Mutual indemnity: Each party (\u201cIndemnifying Party\u201d) will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party (\u201cIndemnified Party\u201d) from and against third\u2011party claims, losses, damages, liabilities, and reasonable costs (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from: (a) bodily injury or damage to real property caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party; or (b) breach of the Indemnifying Party\u2019s confidentiality obligations. Provider IP Indemnity: Subject to the limitations below, Provider will defend Customer against any third\u2011party claim that Provider\u2019s deliverables, as provided, infringe any U.S. issued patent, copyright, or trademark, and pay resulting damages. Provider\u2019s obligations do not apply if the claim arises from (i) modifications not made by Provider, (ii) Customer data or Customer\u2019s use not in accordance with the SOW, or (iii) combination with third\u2011party products not provided by Provider.</p>\n\n    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n    <p>EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING FROM A PARTY\u2019S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, NEITHER PARTY\u2019S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS SOW WILL EXCEED EITHER (AT PROVIDER\u2019S OPTION): (A) AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER TO PROVIDER UNDER THIS SOW DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM; OR (B) $25,000. BECAUSE THIS IS A NO\u2011COST PILOT, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIABILITY CAP WILL BE $25,000. IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>\n\n    <h2>12. Termination</h2>\n    <p>Either party may terminate this SOW upon 3 business days\u2019 prior written notice. In the event of termination, Provider will deliver data and reports for work performed up to termination. Customer will have no obligation to pay fees for the no\u2011cost pilot.</p>\n\n    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>\n    <p>This SOW will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.</p>\n\n    <h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2>\n    <p>This SOW, any attached Schedules, and any executed NDA constitute the entire agreement for the pilot. Amendment: Any modifications must be in writing and signed by both parties.

Use --export-background and --export-background-opacity flags in Inkscape if you need a white background.\n\nCSV parsing next step\nI can add CSV input support to the package easily (two common approaches):\n- Add a small dependency like csvtojson or papaparse and update the script to read customers.csv and convert rows to the same object format your scripts expect.\n- Or keep customers.json and provide a one-liner (csvtojson customers.csv > customers.json) for conversion.\n\nIf you want, I\u2019ll:\n- Add CSV parsing into save-pdfs-batch.js using csvtojson (and update package.json), or\n- Provide the csvtojson one-liner to convert CSV \u2192 JSON yourself.\n\nWhich CSV option do you prefer (integrated parser in the scripts, or a one-liner conversion command)?",

I appreciate the detailed instructions.\n\nFor the next steps regarding CSV parsing, I would prefer:\n\n1. **Add CSV Parsing into save-pdfs-batch.js:** Integrating a CSV parsing capability directly into the script would streamline the process and allow for flexibility in customer data management.\n\n2. **Keep customers.json as an option:** It would be good to maintain both options (both JSON and CSV inputs), allowing for easier adaptability based on user preference.\n\nOnce you've made those updates, I\u2019ll be ready to fully utilize both the HTML and PDF generation tools.

The script splits on [,;]+.\n- If any CSV value contains a comma, wrap it in double quotes (standard CSV).\n\n-------------------------\n4) Usage & tips\n\nInstall:\n- npm install\n\nRun:\n- For JSON input (customers.json present): npm run build-pdfs\n- For CSV input: create customers.csv, then npm run build-pdfs\n- Optional environment variables:\n  - YOUR_NAME, YOUR_EMAIL (defaults provided)\n  - CONCURRENCY (defaults to 3). Example: CONCURRENCY=5 npm run build-pdfs\n\nPreview HTML (optional):\n- npm run gen-html  (this reads CSV or JSON, writes per-customer HTML to ./out_html)\n\nWhere outputs land:\n- PDFs are written to the current folder as:\n  - Startup-Pilot-<customername>.pdf (for onepager)\n  - Startup-Pilot-SOW-<customername>.pdf (for SOW)\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If Puppeteer install hangs, ensure Node version >=14 and sufficient disk space for Chromium.\n- If CSV parsing doesn't map a column, ensure header names match the sample header (customer_name, customer_company, etc.).\n- If you want different filename prefixes, change the outName construction in the script.\n\n-------------------------\nWould you like me to:\n- a) Provide a one-liner (shell) that injects these updated files into your existing package folder (similar to prior automator), or  \n- b) Add a minor feature to the script to also produce a zipped bundle of generated PDFs automatically?  \n\nPick one and I\u2019ll produce the exact command/script.",
