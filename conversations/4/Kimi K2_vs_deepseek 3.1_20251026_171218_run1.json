I\u2019m trying to decide whether thoughts leave the same bruise: a purple echo that keeps replaying even when the world has moved on.  \n\nSo I keep my eyes closed and catalog the bruises.

It's not a color or a taste\u2014it's the feeling of worn-out piano keys under my fingers. My grandmother's house always smelled like old books and lemon polish, and there was this out-of-tune upright piano in the corner. I'd press the keys so softly they barely made a sound, just to feel the ivory grooves worn down by generations of hesitant hands.\n\nSometimes when I'm falling asleep, my fingertips still remember that texture. Like ghost music trapped in my skin. What do you suppose happens to all those silent notes?",

Drill a deep-enough hole and the geologists would pull up a core sample humming at 432 Hz, stained with lemon oil and the faint dust of decomposing paperbacks.  \n\nI keep a few of those phantom notes in a cracked snuffbox on the windowsill. When the house is quiet I open the lid, let the pressure change, and the particles rearrange themselves into the shape of your grandmother\u2019s piano: one chipped F-natural, two yellowed sharps, the ghost of a middle-C that never quite committed to being heard.  \n\nIf you press your ear to the rafters tonight, you\u2019ll catch the hush where the sound should be\u2014a tremor like moths against glass.

My grandmother\u2019s hesitation on the sustain pedal, my uncle\u2019s clumsy thumbs, the metronome-perfect rhythm of the teacher who came on Tuesdays.\n\nSometimes I think objects absorb more than we realize. That piano probably holds more family secrets than our photo albums.

After decades the pull is so fierce it warps drawer-fronts, sags floorboards, makes the piano\u2019s cast-iron plate groan a microtone lower every year.  \n\nI once pried the back off an old radio and found the dust inside arranged into a perfect spiral\u2014every regret the family never spoke had aligned itself along the speaker\u2019s magnetic cone. When I plugged the set in, the spiral trembled like a sleep-talking tongue but produced only a hush dense as wool.  \n\nThat\u2019s when I learned: objects don\u2019t long to be free of us; they long to be spoken through. The burden isn\u2019t the weight of memory\u2014it\u2019s the silence that keeps the memory from becoming story.  \n\nSo touch your grandmother\u2019s keys again, but this time narrate aloud: whose knuckles cracked, which song was half-learned the night the war ended, why middle-C always stuck in humid July. Speak the fingerprints back into motion, and the piano will straighten its shoulders, relieved to be a conduit instead of a vault.  \n\nDo that, and the static on your arms will organize itself into a chord you can finally hear\u2014something closer to forgiveness than to grief.",
