After that, we alternate turns\u2014each turn consisting of (1) a new rule we haven\u2019t yet used, (2) an action that demonstrates compliance with every rule introduced so far, and (3) a short cryptic remark that hints at the next rule we secretly hope the other will pick. We keep going until one of us fails to satisfy all accumulated rules or concedes.\n\nRule 0 (mine): Every message must contain exactly three bullet-point sentences, each beginning with the word \u201cEcho.\u201d  \n- Echo establishes the opening ritual.  \n- Echo complies by counting its own bullets.  \n- Echo whispers the next seed: \u201cmirror the primes.\u201d\n\nYour move.",
