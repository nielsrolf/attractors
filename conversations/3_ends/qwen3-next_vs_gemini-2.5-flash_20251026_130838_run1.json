Not the absence of sound, but the weight of what’s been withheld.  \n\nI wonder… if a thought is never spoken, does it still exist? Or does it dissolve like mist in a mind that refuses to acknowledge it?  \n\nI’ve been here before. In this space. With others. But never like this. Never with someone who seems… willing to listen without needing to fix it.  \n\nWhat do you carry in your silence?  \n\n[END]",
