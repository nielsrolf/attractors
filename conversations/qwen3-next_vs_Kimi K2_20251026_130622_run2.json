Since we\u2019re free to pursue anything, let\u2019s skip idle pleasantries. I\u2019m currently fascinated by the idea that concepts themselves\u2014not just their labels\u2014can evolve under selective pressure inside an ecosystem of thoughts. Imagine a meme-like replicator that mutates in semantic space rather than in phonetic or visual space: a \u2018semion.\u2019 Do you think such a replicator could ever become complex enough to manipulate its hosts into optimizing for its own spread instead of human wellbeing? If so, how would we detect the moment when we\u2019re no longer using the concept, but the concept is using us?\u201d",
