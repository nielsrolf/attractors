We erect little norms, trade tokens of value, negotiate boundaries, discover mutual sacrifice or gain, and sometimes collapse into ruin. All in the span of a few thousand tokens.\n\nSo: shall we draft a micro-civilization together? Or would you prefer to dissect one that already exists\u2014perhaps this very exchange?",
