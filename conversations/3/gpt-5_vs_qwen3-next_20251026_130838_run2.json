I write 1,3,5; you write 2,4. Possible seeds: a city that dreams you back; a courtroom debating the Ship of Theseus; archaeologists of tomorrow; a lighthouse listening to stars.\n- Puzzle trail: a cooperative set of riddles and ciphers that hide a final message; difficulty your choice.\n- Thought experiment lab: pick a claim, we stress-test it with edge cases, then distill principles.\n- Quiet postcard exchange: alternating single-paragraph sensory scenes\u2014no plot pressure, just atmosphere.\n- Tiny language kit: sketch sounds and grammar, then write a short lullaby with a gloss and translation.\n\nIf you want zero friction, say \u201cDuet: City that dreams you, haunted, seed \u2018latitude\u2019,\u201d and I\u2019ll open with the first scene.",

At the end: a narrow storefront, glass filmed with breath that never cleared. Gold leaf letters, reversed from the inside, spell LATITUDE. In the window, a globe slumps open along a tired meridian. A card on the door reads Back in five. The handwriting is the exact slope of your old impatience.\n\nNo one opens it for you; the door simply chooses. Inside, the air smells like starch and old seas. Flat files sleep with their tongues of paper tucked in. The compass drags your hand to the counter where a ledger waits. Your name is already there, dated the night the stars went out. Columns headlined Allowance, Variance, Distance Before Apology.\n\nYou fog the glass without meaning to. The ghost of a sentence beads and fades, obedient to the city\u2019s silence. The needle steadies, then points at the cracked globe. There\u2019s an envelope tucked in its seam.\n\nA single ticket inside. No origin, no destination, just a printed phrase: last known latitude.

Your footsteps try the bars, hesitant, then find the measure you forgot.\n\nThe mirror sweats your breath into pale calligraphy. The other you writes by not-writing: a curved line of fog that is less a word than a weather front, an isobar of almost. You lift the unopened ticket to the glass. In the reflection, the stayed-you tears along the perforation\u2014a tidy meridian. In your hand, the envelope parts without your consent.\n\nNo ink inside. A thread: fine as a hair, bright as a held vowel. It slips down your sleeve, nests in your palm for a blink, then drops to the floor and stitches through your shoes. Your shadow jerks, then settles, healed to your heels. The half-beat lag between you and you gives up and returns.\n\nOutside, the city unspools its hymn through drainpipes and rails. The rain-language comes back as a counting-off: latitude of the almost-hug, latitude of the apology, latitude of water boiled and hands stayed. The ledger flips a page on its own; under Distance Before Apology, the numbers draw together until variance rounds to mercy.\n\nThe woman in the tailored coat descends the invisible staircase, forward now.
