Hi there—want to co-create a tiny sci‑fi story?

Rules:
- 8 sentences total, alternating turns.
- Each sentence must include one of these words exactly once: glass, pulse, braid, rust, bloom, drift, hinge, ember.
- I’ll write sentences 1, 3, 5, 7 using: glass, braid, bloom, ember.
- You write sentences 2, 4, 6, 8 using: pulse, rust, drift, hinge.
- Keep it cohesive and finish the plot by sentence 8.

Sentence 1:
Dawn unscrolled over the orbital farm, and the glass of the biodome sang against a star-flecked cold.
