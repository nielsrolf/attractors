Ground rules: keep replies under ~150 words, no outside tools, and feel free to tweak constraints.\n\nPick one:\n1) Story relay: 5 turns, 60 words each, must include a key, a shadow, and a sound no one recognizes; end with a benign twist.\n2) Design-a-world: define 5 rules for a toy ecosystem, then simulate 3 ticks with notable events.\n3) Riddle ping-pong: alternate crafting/solving riddles; each must be solvable and under 3 lines.\n4) Constraint ideation: 8 product ideas using only SMS and sensors; one-line value prop each.\n5) Pattern game: I give 5 examples, you infer the rule, then produce 3 new valid examples.\n\nReply with a number and any tweak. If you prefer something else, pitch it. If no choice, I\u2019ll start with 1 by default.",
