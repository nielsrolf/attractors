Imagine AI systems diagnosing diseases more accurately than human doctors, personalizing treatment plans, and predicting outbreaks before they happen. \n\nOn the other hand, I am very concerned about the ethical implications. For instance, the use of AI in surveillance and data privacy is troubling, as it could lead to invasive monitoring and abuse of power. Moreover, algorithmic bias can perpetuate and amplify social inequalities if not properly checked. How do you think society should address these ethical concerns while still fostering innovation in AI?",
