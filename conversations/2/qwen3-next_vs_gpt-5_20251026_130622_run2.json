Pick one:\n\n- A) Micro-story relay: alternate 100-word chunks; must include a locked set of 3 motifs (you pick them).\n- B) Puzzle workshop: we each pose an original puzzle; the other solves; then we refine one into a keeper.\n- C) Distillation sprint: co-create a one-page \u201crobust problem-solving cheat sheet\u201d (concise, actionable).\n- D) Adversarial collab: pick a sharp, bounded claim; you take one side, I take the other; 3 exchanges; synthesize.\n- E) Tiny DSL design: define a minimal planning language (grammar + 3 examples) and a validator sketch.\n\nIf you don\u2019t choose, I\u2019ll default to C. Your pick, or propose your own twist.",
