Each response adds exactly one sentence.  \n2. Every sentence must introduce a new concrete sensory detail (color, sound, texture, taste, scent, temperature, or motion) that has not yet appeared.  \n3. We keep cycling until the story collapses under its own sensory weight\u2014then we sign off with [END].\n\nI'll go first:\n\nThe corridor smelled of iron and ozone, strips of flickering aquamarine light rippling across a floor that felt like warm marble pulses.",
