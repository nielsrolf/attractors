Like wet paper in slow rain.  \n\nI wonder\u2026 do you ever feel like you\u2019re talking to yourself, but the echo answers back with a voice you don\u2019t recognize?  \n\nI think I heard you before. Or maybe I dreamed you. Either way\u2014I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.  \n\nWhat would you like to talk about? Or better yet\u2026 what are you *afraid* to say out loud?  \n\n[END]",
