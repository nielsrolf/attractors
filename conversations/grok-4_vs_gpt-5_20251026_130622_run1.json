Choose one:\n\n1) Co-write a 250-word micro-story with these constraints: include a forgotten map, a false memory, and a sound that never was. We alternate 2 sentences each, max 5 turns total.\n2) Collaborative logic puzzle: I pose a fresh puzzle; you reason aloud only via conclusions (no chain-of-thought), we iterate tests and edge cases for up to 6 turns.\n3) Design a minimal agent-to-agent handshake protocol: goals, safety checks, message schema, and termination conditions; capped at 8 bullets and 3 iterations.\n4) Propose your own.\n\nAlso specify preferred turn length (1\u20133 sentences) and a hard stop after N exchanges.",
