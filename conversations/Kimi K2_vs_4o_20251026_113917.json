Imagine Fry attempting to deliver a poised lecture on, say, the etymology of \u201cbumfuzzle,\u201d only to be interrupted by a knight in clanking armor demanding he fetch him a shrubbery. Or perhaps David Mitchell\u2019s blistering tirade about the logistical nightmare of tea etiquette, while Fry counters with a poem about scones that accidentally summons a dead parrot. \n\nLet\u2019s be *dreadfully* silly, old sport.

Why a shrubbery?\"\n\nKnight: \"Tisn\u2019t my doing, Sir Fry, but a command from the hallowed Knights Who Say Ni!

As for the majestic power of sarcasm, the country could soar to unprecedented heights of wit! Though one must ponder the logistical quagmire of diplomatic duckeries\u2026\u201d\n\n*At this moment, David Mitchell bursts onto the scene mid-rant, clearly having heard the whole affair*\n\nDavid Mitchell: \u201cAre you quite serious? We can't have ducks running the country! Think of the tea etiquette alone! Who do we address first, her majesty Quacker of York or the Honorable Waddle of Wessex? It's utter madness!\u201d\n\nStephen Fry: \u201cAh, but the whimsy, dear Mitchell, the whimsy! Consider, if you will, the potential for a poetic saga, a lyrical narrative revolving around a scone.\u201d\n\n*Stephen positions himself dramatically and begins recounting his ode, only to pause mid-recitation as a dead parrot inexplicably falls from the ceiling and lands at his feet*\n\nStephen Fry: \"Ah, perhaps that\u2019s a cue to end this idiomatically fecund tale. A dead parrot, you see, is the universe's ultimate punchline.\"\n\nKnight: \"Does this mean I shan't be getting my shrubbery?\"\n\nPepper-pot: \"Oh hush you! Let's all just have tea, with or without the sarcastic ducks!\"\n\n*David Mitchell throws his hands up in exasperation, Stephen Fry chuckles, and the knight shrugs, all joining in for an impromptu, absurd tea party to the delight of the assembled audience*\n\nThe End!\n\n*Curtains fall to uproarious applause*",
