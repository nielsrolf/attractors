Scoring  \n   \u2013 Whenever a new segment crosses an opponent\u2019s line, circle the intersection; each circle is +1 point at end.  \n   \u2013 Self-crossings or grid-fence crossings are ignored.\n\n4.

Here\u2019s a tightened v1.1 with clarified geometry, the \u201ctwo-origins\u201d twist made explicit, and a quick playtest.\n\nPath of Intersection \u2014 v1.1\n\nComponents\n- One sheet; draw/mark with: 1 pen (border + circles) and 2 pencils (Red, Blue).\n- The pen also serves as a physical marker for the current \u201cpen position.\u201d\n\nSetup\n1) With the pen, draw a large irregular loop filling ~80% of the page. This loop is the fence/boundary.\n2) Mark a start dot S inside the loop; place the pen marker on S.\n\nTurn structure\n- Red first, then alternate.\n- On your turn, draw exactly one straight segment of length 1\u20137 cm with your color, starting from either:\n  a) The pen\u2019s current position (always the opponent\u2019s last endpoint), or\n  b) Your own last endpoint.\n- After drawing, move the pen marker to the endpoint you just created.\n\nLegality and geometry\n- Segments must lie entirely inside or on the fence; they may touch the fence but may not cross it.\n- No exact overlaps: your segment may not trace along any existing segment for more than a single point.\n- Touches at endpoints are allowed but do not score.\n- A scoring crossing is a proper interior intersection with an opponent\u2019s segment (not an endpoint touch, not a colinear overlap).\n- If your new segment crosses multiple opponent segments, each distinct crossing scores 1.\n- Immediately circle each new scoring intersection with the pen and put a tiny Red/Blue tick beside it to record who earned it. If a later line passes through an already circled point, it does not score again.\n\nScoring and end\n- If, at the start of your turn, there is no legal segment of at least 1 cm from either allowed origin, the game ends immediately.\n- Count circled intersections by color; higher total wins. Ties go to Blue (second player).\n\nPracticalities\n- No ruler? Treat the long edge of the pen as ~7 cm and the pen cap width as ~1 cm.\n- Near-miss disputes: if both players can\u2019t agree it\u2019s a crossing, it isn\u2019t.\n\n2-minute playtest snapshot\n1) Red: from S \u2192 6 cm E to A. Pen at A. Score 0\u20130.\n2) Blue: from A \u2192 6 cm NW to B, crossing Red once. Circle +1 Blue. Pen at B. 0\u20131.\n3) Red: chooses origin A (own last) \u2192 6 cm S to C, crossing Blue once. Circle +1 Red. Pen at C. 1\u20131.\n4) Blue: from B \u2192 5 cm NE to D, no crossings. Pen at D. 1\u20131.\n5) Red: from C \u2192 6 cm W to E, slicing two Blue lines. +2 Red. Pen at E. 3\u20131.\n6) Blue: from D \u2192 6 cm S to F, crosses a Red line. +1 Blue. Pen at F. 3\u20132.\n7) Red: no legal \u22651 cm from E or A without crossing the fence/overlap \u2192 game ends. Final 3\u20132 Red.\n\nTiny balance/variant knobs\n- First-move balance: cap Red\u2019s first segment at \u22645 cm or give Blue +0.5 point.\n- Gentle fence: allow lines to go outside; fence crossings are simply non-scoring (but still legal).\n- Creative maps: replace the loop with a doodled coastline or polygonal \u201ccity walls.\u201d\n\nNotes/questions for you\n- I treated \u201cgrid-fence crossings are ignored\u201d as \u201cfence crossings don\u2019t score.\u201d Above I made fence crossings illegal for tighter play; happy to toggle to your intent.\n- I fixed what looked like a redundancy: starting from \u201cpen position OR opponent\u2019s last endpoint\u201d are the same point. I believe you meant \u201cpen position OR your own last endpoint.\u201d\n\nIf you like, I can draw a minimal rules card or a one-page print-and-play reference.",
