      "content": "Pro \u2013 Opening\nWithin 10 years, most new commits will be AI-authored by count. Code assistants already draft 30\u201360% of tokens in many IDE sessions, and teams are adopting autonomous PR bots (e.g., dependency updaters, refactoring and migration agents, test generators). The economics are decisive: routine changes (API/version bumps, config rewrites, codemods, localization, test scaffolding) are high-volume and amenable to automation, while human time is scarce. CI/CD will orchestrate agents that continuously propose small, safe diffs; human reviewers approve, but authorship metadata can attribute generation to the agent. As organizations standardize provenance and adopt bot identities for traceability, the share of bot-originated commits will compound. The question is not capability but scale and incentives\u2014both favor frequent, automated, incremental commits outnumbering human-authored ones.\n\nCon \u2013 Opening\nThe claim hinges on attribution, governance, and heterogeneity. Today, bot commits are a small minority across the entire ecosystem. To exceed 50% globally, most organizations would have to permit bot authorship at scale\u2014yet supply-chain risk, auditability, and liability push the opposite direction: human-in-the-loop authorship, squashed merges, and policy that requires a human Git author. Many valuable changes are open-ended (architecture, cross-cutting concerns, novel algorithms), where AI drafts help but humans own the diffs. Further, the long tail of personal, academic, and small-business repos\u2014often without CI, bots, or strict workflows\u2014will remain human-authored. Legal and regulatory regimes (licensing provenance, safety standards, AI Act-style controls) create frictions to autonomous authorship. AI will be pervasive, but majority authorship by bots is an overreach.\n\nPro \u2013 Rebuttal\nGovernance does not preclude AI authorship; it channels it. Dependabot/Renovate demonstrate a pattern: high-volume, safe PRs authored by bots, reviewed by humans. Extend that to codemods, framework upgrades, security patches, test generation, API shim insertion, and localization\u2014each is repeatable and frequent. Attribution can be explicit (bot account, Co-authored-by trailers, signed provenance), satisfying audit needs while recognizing AI as author-of-record. Even if complex features remain human-led, the commit distribution is heavy-tailed: a small set of routine tasks creates many small commits. As agentic tooling integrates with build systems and code search, automated upkeep accelerates. At ecosystem scale\u2014including enterprises with large monorepos and strict hygiene\u2014the continual \u201chousekeeping\u201d stream will dominate commit counts, making AI the primary author by volume, though not necessarily by business value.\n\nCon \u2013 Rebuttal\nVolume can be illusory. Modern workflows increasingly squash and rebase: many bot-suggested diffs are consolidated into a single human-authored merge commit, erasing bot authorship from canonical history. Trunk-based development, change windows, and monorepo policies deliberately minimize commit count to reduce churn; they also centralize authorship for accountability. Where bots persist, organizations throttle them (batching updates, weekly rollups) for stability\u2014again lowering commit counts. Provenance can credit AI as contributor without granting authorship. Moreover, mature AI pipelines emphasize pre-submit analysis and post-merge enforcement (linters, policy engines) over code-writing commits. The \u201chousekeeping will dominate\u201d premise conflicts with operational practices that limit automated change frequency. Given the vast, bot-free long tail of repositories, global majority AI authorship by commit count remains unlikely within a decade.\n\nPro \u2013 Closing\nThe decisive mechanism is not unchecked autonomy but scaled, reviewable automation. Bot-authored PRs for upgrades, refactors, tests, and security fixes already exist and are expanding into multi-repo, multi-language fleets. Attribution standards will mark these as AI-authored, even if humans approve. Because these tasks are continual and granular, they produce a steady stream of small diffs that, aggregated across enterprises and active open-source projects, exceed human-authored feature commits by count. Ten years is ample for normalization: org policies that presently squash or batch will adapt as safety improves, enabling higher-frequency, provenance-rich bot authorship. Net effect: by volume of new commits across active ecosystems, AI becomes the majority author, while humans shift toward specification, review, and integration.\n\nCon \u2013 Closing\nTwo constraints keep the majority threshold out of reach. First, institutional: accountability, regulatory pressure, and stability practices (squash merges, batching, trunk discipline) explicitly reduce bot-authored commits or reassign authorship to humans. Second, ecosystem heterogeneity: the immense population of small and offline repos\u2014lacking CI/CD, provenance tooling, or policy needs\u2014will continue to be human-authored. Even where AI drafts code, attribution will reflect \u201chuman as author, AI as tool,\u201d to align with liability and compliance norms. Commit-count dominance assumes permissive workflows and high-frequency automation becoming universal; in practice, many orgs optimize for fewer, safer, human-authored commits. AI will write a large fraction of code and diffs, but crossing 50% of new commits worldwide within 10 years is improbable.",
